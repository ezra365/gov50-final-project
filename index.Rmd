## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to Russian National Security and 
Counter-Insurgency. I would like to find a data-set related to this in some
capacity. One further theme which I'm interested in is 
Gazprom and the impacts of turning off the gas taps on European foreign policy.
